## Ensemble Model Comparison

Table [3](#tab:model_performance){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:model_performance"} presents comprehensive performance metrics across all models on spatially-separated test data (n=200 samples, 20% stratified split from a total dataset of 1,000 samples with 10 engineered features).

: Model Performance Comparison
:::

**Key Findings:**

**1. Voting Ensemble Superiority:** Despite identical AUC-ROC performance of 0.9208, the Voting Ensemble was selected as the production model due to its simpler architecture without meta-learning, better generalization with lower variance across folds, smaller model size of 1.6 MB compared to 3.2 MB, faster inference without meta-model overhead, and greater interpretability with equal weights.

**2. Individual Model Analysis:** LightGBM achieves the best individual performance with AUC of 0.9243, but ensembling provides enhanced robustness and reduces overfitting risk.

**3. Stacking Meta-Weights:** Learned weights (RF=3.60, LGBM=1.86, XGB=0.40) reveal RF predictions offer greatest complementarity despite lower individual AUC---demonstrating meta-learning can identify non-obvious synergies.

**Success Rate:** $TP/(TP+FP) = 84/98 = 85.7\%$ vs 30% industry baseline, representing 2.9$\times$ improvement.

**Economic Impact:** Traditional exploration requires 100 boreholes at \$150,000 each totaling \$15 million and yielding 30 discoveries at \$500,000 per discovery, while GAP-guided exploration uses only 15 boreholes at \$150,000 each totaling \$2.25 million and yielding 11 discoveries at \$205,000 per discovery, representing a \$295,000 per discovery savings or 59% cost reduction.

## Spatial Validation Results

Geographic block cross-validation using 5-fold validation with 50km separation yields a mean AUC of 0.9180 ± 0.0142, with spatial autocorrelation measured by Moran's I = 0.23 (p \< 0.001), compared to an inflated AUC of 0.9350 from standard K-Fold cross-validation.

This 1.7% difference validates the necessity of spatial validation for honest performance reporting in geospatial applications.
