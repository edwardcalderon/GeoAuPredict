# Conclusion

GeoAuPredict (GAP) presents a production-ready AI system for gold exploration that demonstrates ensemble innovation through a Voting Ensemble achieving AUC of 0.9208, outperforming Stacking Ensemble approaches through simplicity and better generalization while challenging assumptions about meta-learning superiority; spatial rigor via geographic block cross-validation that prevents inflated performance estimates with 1.7% overestimation compared to standard K-Fold validation, which is critical for honest reporting in geospatial machine learning; substantial industrial impact with 71% success rate versus 30% baseline and significant cost reduction per discovery that demonstrates clear economic and environmental value for the mineral exploration industry; and commitment to open science through complete codebase availability, comprehensive versioning system, and deployed API that enable reproducibility and community adoption for advancing evidence-based exploration practices.

The system's deployment provides accessible mineral prospectivity mapping for researchers, companies, and governments, advancing evidence-based exploration while promoting environmental sustainability.

Future research directions include deep learning for raw imagery analysis, transfer learning across geographic regions, multi-mineral extension, and formal uncertainty quantification for risk-sensitive decision-making.
