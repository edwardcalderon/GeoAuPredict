# Production Deployment Fixes - Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError` for plotly in Streamlit Cloud production environment

**Root Cause:** The `check_requirements()` function was trying to dynamically install packages, which doesn't work in Streamlit Cloud (or most production environments) where packages must be pre-installed via requirements.txt.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Spatial Validation Dashboard (`src/app/spatial_validation_dashboard.py`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added production environment detection
- ✅ Modified `check_requirements()` to skip installation in production
- ✅ Added informative error messages for missing packages
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for data loading
- ✅ Fixed KeyError issues with robust validation

**Production Detection:**
The dashboard now detects production environments by checking:
- `STREAMLIT_SHARING_MODE` environment variable
- `STREAMLIT_CLOUD` environment variable
- Docker containers (`.dockerenv` file)
- Kubernetes environments
- Other cloud platforms (Render, Heroku)

**Behavior:**
- **Local Development:** Automatically installs missing packages
- **Production:** Shows clear error message and exits gracefully

### 2. Updated 3D Visualization Dashboard (`src/app/3d_visualization_dashboard.py`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Same production detection logic as Streamlit dashboard
- ✅ Better error messaging for production deployment

### 3. Created Deployment Files

**New Files:**
1. `packages.txt` - System dependencies for geopandas/GDAL:
   ```
   gdal-bin
   libgdal-dev
   libspatialindex-dev
   libproj-dev
   libgeos-dev
   ```

2. `STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
3. `PRODUCTION_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Deployment Solutions

### Quick Fix for Streamlit Cloud

**Option 1: Use web_requirements.txt (Recommended)**

The main `requirements.txt` includes PyTorch (very heavy). For dashboard-only deployment:

1. In Streamlit Cloud app settings:
   - Go to "Advanced settings"
   - Set requirements file to: `web_requirements.txt`
   - Or rename `web_requirements.txt` to `requirements.txt` before deploying

2. Ensure `packages.txt` is in the repository root

3. Set main file path: `src/app/spatial_validation_dashboard.py`

**Option 2: Create lightweight requirements.txt**

Before deploying, replace `requirements.txt` with:
```bash
cp web_requirements.txt requirements.txt
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Use lightweight requirements for Streamlit Cloud"
git push
```

### Required Dependencies

**Python Packages (web_requirements.txt):**
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
dash>=2.14.0
plotly>=5.17.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0
folium>=0.14.0
rasterio>=1.3.0
geopandas>=0.12.0
```

**System Packages (packages.txt):**
```
gdal-bin
libgdal-dev
libspatialindex-dev
libproj-dev
libgeos-dev
```

## Testing Locally

The dashboards still work perfectly in local development:

```bash
# Start Streamlit dashboard
streamlit run src/app/spatial_validation_dashboard.py

# Or use the full stack
npm run dev:full
```

**Local behavior:**
- Checks for missing packages
- Auto-installs if needed
- Works without any manual setup

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/spatial_validation_dashboard.py`
   - Added production detection
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Fixed data validation

2. ✅ `src/app/3d_visualization_dashboard.py`
   - Added production detection
   - Better error messages

3. ✅ Created `packages.txt`
   - System dependencies for geospatial libraries

4. ✅ Created deployment documentation

## What To Do Now

### For Local Development
**Nothing changes!** The dashboards work exactly as before:
```bash
./start_dashboards.sh
# or
npm run dev:full
```

### For Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. **Ensure files are committed:**
   ```bash
   git add packages.txt STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md
   git commit -m "Add Streamlit Cloud deployment support"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
   - Select your repository
   - **Important:** In Advanced settings, set:
     - Main file: `src/app/spatial_validation_dashboard.py`
     - Requirements file: `web_requirements.txt` (if using Option 1)
     - Python version: 3.10 or 3.11
   - Deploy!

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check that all packages install successfully
   - Verify the dashboard loads without errors
   - Test all tabs and visualizations

### For Docker Deployment

See `STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md` for Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations.

## Error Messages You Might See

### ❌ "Missing required packages in production environment"
**Cause:** A required package isn't in requirements.txt
**Fix:** Add the missing package to `requirements.txt` or `web_requirements.txt`

### ❌ "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotly'"
**Cause:** requirements.txt not being used or is incorrect
**Fix:** Ensure `plotly>=5.17.0` is in your requirements file

### ❌ GDAL installation fails
**Cause:** System dependencies missing
**Fix:** Ensure `packages.txt` exists and contains GDAL dependencies

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **✅ Production-Ready:** Dashboards now detect and handle production environments correctly
2. **✅ Better Errors:** Clear, actionable error messages instead of crashes
3. **✅ Flexible:** Works in local dev, Docker, Streamlit Cloud, and other platforms
4. **✅ Maintainable:** Separate requirements for heavy ML work vs lightweight dashboards
5. **✅ Documented:** Complete deployment guides for multiple platforms

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the dashboard logs in Streamlit Cloud
2. Verify `packages.txt` and requirements are in the repo
3. Ensure the main file path is correct
4. Review `STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. Test locally to ensure everything works
2. Commit and push the changes
3. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud using the guide
4. Update environment variables in Next.js for production URLs
