\begin{abstract}
This project develops an open-source geospatial artificial intelligence system for the detection and prediction of gold deposits in Colombia and worldwide, integrating geochemical, geophysical, satellite, and drilling data while applying deep learning techniques and 3D spatial models to generate probability maps of gold presence, enabling more efficient, sustainable, and auditable decision-making in mineral exploration. Traditional mineral exploration relies heavily on physical drilling campaigns, making it costly, high-risk, time-consuming, and environmentally impactful, with existing open studies on gold prospectivity applying artificial intelligence and geospatial data still lacking widely replicated, auditable, and generalizable models that integrate multiple data sources (geochemical, satellite, geophysical, and drilling) to predict gold-bearing areas in a scalable and accessible way, limiting evidence-based decision-making, restricting access to open methodologies for responsible exploration, and keeping entry costs high for sustainable mining projects. This document presents a comprehensive framework for predicting and visualizing potential gold deposits using multimodal remote sensing, geochemical, and geological datasets, inspired by the EarthScape dataset and the Colombian alluvial gold prospectivity model, aiming to create a reproducible AI pipeline that integrates public data from USGS, SGC, Sentinel-2, and ASTER to improve sustainable exploration decisions and transparency in mineral resource discovery.
\end{abstract}

\section*{1. Introduction}
Traditional mineral exploration is expensive, slow, and environmentally invasive due to its dependence on physical drilling and field sampling, with existing private machine learning applications but scarce open and replicable frameworks for mineral prospectivity. This project bridges that gap by proposing a fully open-source pipeline that leverages multimodal geospatial data and deep learning to predict gold occurrence, supporting sustainable exploration in Colombia and other resource-rich regions.

\section*{2. Related Work}
\subsection*{EarthScape Dataset (2025)}
The \textbf{EarthScape} initiative (University of Kentucky) introduced a large-scale 
AI-ready geospatial dataset integrating optical imagery, DEMs, hydrological, 
and infrastructural data. It demonstrated that multimodal fusion enhances 
surface geological mapping without drilling.

\subsection*{Machine Learning for Alluvial Gold (2025) — Colombian Ground Truth}
The \textbf{Colombian alluvial gold study} developed by ITM, UdeA, and UNAL serves as the 
ground-truth model for borehole-level training and validation. Focused on Caucasia, Antioquia 
(Cauca River basin) with 147 boreholes and 8,642 samples, this research compares three 
machine learning approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NLP-based 3D Modeling:} GloVe embeddings for lithological text analysis
    \item \textbf{CNN + Positional Encoder:} ResNet18 with transfer learning on DEM patches  
    \item \textbf{Linear Interpolation Baseline:} Traditional geostatistical approach
\end{itemize}

The hybrid CNN-DEM model achieved superior performance by integrating topographic data 
with borehole information, establishing the methodological foundation for subsurface 
gold occurrence prediction. The complete implementation is available at 
\href{https://github.com/francobr991/Mapeo_prospectivo}{github.com/francobr991/Mapeo\_prospectivo}.

These works validate the use of multimodal deep learning for mineral prospectivity 
and inspire the architecture adopted here.
