## Abstract
This study presents GeoAuPredict (GAP), an open-source geospatial artificial intelligence system for predicting gold deposits in Colombia using multimodal remote sensing and geological data. Traditional mineral exploration relies on expensive drilling campaigns, while existing AI approaches lack integration of multiple data sources for scalable, reproducible gold prospectivity mapping. We develop a three-phase deep learning architecture that fuses satellite imagery, geochemical data, geophysical surveys, and borehole information to generate continuous probability fields of gold presence. The framework integrates EarthScape methodology with Colombian geological datasets, achieving improved accuracy through multimodal fusion and transfer learning. Results demonstrate successful implementation across Colombian territories with 27 additional geological variables, providing a reproducible pipeline for global mineral exploration that reduces environmental impact while maintaining scientific rigor.

# Introduction
Mineral exploration traditionally relies on extensive drilling campaigns that are costly, time-intensive, and environmentally invasive citep{traditional_exploration}. The high financial risk and ecological impact of conventional methods have driven the development of alternative approaches using artificial intelligence and geospatial data analysis. However, existing open-source frameworks for mineral prospectivity mapping remain limited in their integration of multiple data modalities and struggle with generalization across different geological terrains.
Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated potential for automated geological feature extraction and subsurface prediction. The EarthScape initiative introduced large-scale AI-ready geospatial datasets that successfully integrate optical imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs), and hydrological data for surface geological mapping without requiring drilling citep{massey2025earthscape}. Complementing this, Colombian research on alluvial gold deposits has established ground-truth datasets using borehole data from the Cauca River basin, comparing traditional geostatistical methods with modern machine learning approaches. Recent studies have also advanced geophysical data analysis techniques for mineral exploration citep{springer2025}.
This study addresses the gap in integrated, open-source mineral prospectivity frameworks by developing GeoAuPredict, a comprehensive AI system that fuses multiple data sources for gold deposit prediction in Colombia. The framework builds upon EarthScape methodology while incorporating local geological knowledge and borehole validation data. By integrating geochemical, geophysical, satellite, and drilling data through a three-phase deep learning architecture, we aim to provide a reproducible, scalable solution for evidence-based mineral exploration decision-making.
The objectives of this research are threefold: (1) develop an integrated AI framework for multimodal geological data fusion, (2) demonstrate improved gold prospectivity mapping accuracy through transfer learning across geological regions, and (3) establish an open-science pipeline that reduces exploration costs while maintaining environmental responsibility. Our approach leverages 27 distinct geological variables and implements uncertainty quantification for reliable exploration targeting.
